# go-big

Think of this project as a DIY distributed computing implementation, 
inspired by [Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark).  

Please do not mistake this for a production-ready tool or library; it is 
merely an educational project for those looking to understand principles 
within distributed computing. 

## Who is this project for?

If you have recently picked up a big data framework such as Apache Spark, 
and are confused by lazy evaluation, execution plans, partitions, map/reduce, etc.
then this is for you! 

I'm treating this framework as a way to understand something like Apache Spark
"by doing" and by looking under the hood. I'm of course no match for the >1,000
brilliant contributors combined on the open source Spark engine, but the core 
concepts are similar and hopefully help you become a better data engineer!
